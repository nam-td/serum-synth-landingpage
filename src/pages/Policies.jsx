          We are very pleased that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
          Data protection is a very high priority for the management of Xfer
          Records. The use of the Internet pages of the Xfer Records is possible
          without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject
          wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing
          of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal
          data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for search
          processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject. The
          processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
          address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
          with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
          with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to
          the Xfer Records. By means of this data protection declaration, our
          enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature,
          scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
          Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
          protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
        </div>
        <div>
          As the controller, the Xfer Records has implemented numerous technical
          and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of
          personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based
          data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
          protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject
          is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
          telephone.
        </div>
        <div>
          1. Definitions The data protection declaration of the Xfer Records is
          based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of
          the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
          declaration should be legible and understandable for the general
          public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
          this, we would like to first explain the terminology used. In this
          data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
          <ul className="px-4 py-4 list-disc flex flex-col gap-y-6">
            <li>
              Personal data Personal data means any information relating to an
              identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An
              identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly
              or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as
              a name, an identification number, location data, an online
              identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
              physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
              identity of that natural person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data subject Data subject is any identified or identifiable
              natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller
              responsible for the processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Processing Processing is any operation or set of operations which
              is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether
              or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
              organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
              retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
              dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or

            <li>
              Restriction of processing Restriction of processing is the marking
              of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing
              in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of
              personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
              certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in
              particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural
              person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
              preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
              movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal
              data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be
              attributed to a specific data subject without the use of
              additional information, provided that such additional information
              is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational
              measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an
              identified or identifiable natural person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Controller or controller responsible for the processing Controller

              legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone
              or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
              processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such
              processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the
              controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be
              provided for by Union or Member State law.
            </li>
            <li>
              Processor Processor is a natural or legal person, public
              authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on

              particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law
              shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data
              by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the
              applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the
              processing.

            <li>
              Third party Third party is a natural or legal person, public
              authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller,
              processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the
              controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

          <div>
            3. Collection of general data and information The website of the
            Xfer Records collects a series of general data and information when
            a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This
            general data and information are stored in the server log files.
            Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
            operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from
            which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers),
            (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the
            Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7)
            the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any
            other similar data and information that may be used in the event of
            attacks on our information technology systems.
          </div>
          <div>
            When using these general data and information, the Xfer Records does
            not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
            information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
            correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its
            advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information
            technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law
            enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
            prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Xfer Records
            analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically,
            with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of
            our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the
            personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files
            are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data
            subject.

        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-6">
          <div>
            4. Registration on our website The data subject has the possibility
            to register on the website of the controller with the indication of
            personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller
            is determined by the respective input mask used for the
            registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are
            collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller,
            and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one
            or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal
            data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the
            controller.
          </div>
          <div>
            By registering on the website of the controller, the IP
            address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by
            the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored.
            The storage of this data takes place against the background that
            this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if
            necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.
            Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the
            controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there
            is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer
            serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
          </div>
          <div>
            The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication
            of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the
            data subject contents or services that may only be offered to
            registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
            Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified
            during the registration at any time, or to have them completely
            deleted from the data stock of the controller.
          </div>
          <div>
            The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon
            request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored
            about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall
            correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the
            data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.
            A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in this data
            protection declaration, as well as the entirety of the controller’s
            employees are available to the data subject in this respect as
            contact persons.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          5. Contact possibility via the website The website of the Xfer Records
          contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our
          enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also
          includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail
          address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a
          contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are
          automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary
          basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the
          purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no
          transfer of this personal data to third parties.
        </div>
        <div>
          6. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data The data controller
          shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for
          the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as
          this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in
          laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to. If the
          storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed
          by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires,
          the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with
          legal requirements.

          <div>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:
          </div>
          <div>
          the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
          </div>
          <div>
          If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.
          </div>
          <div>
          c) Right to rectification
          </div>
          <div>
          ach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
          If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.
          </div>
          <div>
          d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
          </div>
          <div>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:
          </div>
          <div>
          The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the Xfer Records, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of the Xfer Records or another employee shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
          </div>
          <div>
          Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. The Data Protection Officer of the Xfer Records or another employee will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.
